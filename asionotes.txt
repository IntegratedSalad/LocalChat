Jak wywolywac funkcje w petli asynchronicznej?
Submituje sie taski (funkcje):
"To submit functions to the io_context, use the dispatch, post or defer free functions"

1. dispatch function:
Dispatch will call the function rightaway if the dispatch-caller was called from io_service itself, but queue it othwerise.

2. Post
Post will not call the function directly, ever, but postpone the call.

It is very worth noting, that running io_context doesn't execute the callbacks asynchronously.
